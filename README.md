This portfolio is a personal project created to highlight my web development skills. It serves as a digital resume and a place to share my coding journey, projects, and technical expertise. It is built with:

    HTML for the structure
    CSS for the styling and responsiveness
    JavaScript for interactive elements

I aim to continually update and improve the portfolio to reflect my growth as a developer.
